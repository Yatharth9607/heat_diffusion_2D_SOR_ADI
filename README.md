# heat_diffusion_2D_SOR_ADI
Solving Fourier's heat diffusion equations in 2D using SOR (Successive Over Relaxation) and ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit) methods

A brief summary of the files in this project is as follows:

1. `heat_diffusion_2D_SOR_ADI.pdf`
Comprehensive report on the solving the heat diffusion equations in two dimensions using SOR and ADI methods

-- Work in progress --
-> developing interactive python modules for the matlab files to directly execute without MATLAB
